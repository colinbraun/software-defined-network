#
# You should also include all of the Self routes in your routing_table argument -- e.g.,  Switch (ID = 4) should include the following entry: 		
# 4,4:4,0
# 0 indicates ‘zero‘ distance
#
# For switches that can’t be reached, the next hop and bandwidth should be ‘-1’ and ‘9999’ respectively. (9999 means infinite distance so that that switch can’t be reached)
#  E.g, If switch=4 cannot reach switch=5, the following should be printed
#  4,5:-1,9999
#
# For any switch that has been killed, do not include the routes that are going out from that switch. 
# One example can be found in the sample log in starter code. 
# After switch 1 is killed, the routing update from the controller does not have routes from switch 1 to other switches.
